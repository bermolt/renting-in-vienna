"""One end-to-end pipeline run: scrape → dedupe → persist → publish → notify.

The pipeline is stateless by design: its only state is ``full_history.csv`` in
a private Kaggle dataset, downloaded at the start of every run and re-uploaded
with the new listings appended. Nothing is written to the git repository, so
runs stay cheap and the history stays out of version control.

Step ordering is deliberate:

1. The private history is persisted *before* any user-visible side effect.
   A corrupted or lost history breaks everything downstream, so state safety
   comes first. The trade-off (notifications are at-most-once: if a later
   step fails, its listings are never re-notified because the next run sees
   them as already known) is acceptable — a rare missed message beats
   duplicate spam and duplicate history rows.
2. The public dataset is rebuilt from the full history on every publication,
   so a failed public upload heals itself on the next successful run.
3. Telegram runs last: it is the least critical step and its failures still
   fail the workflow run, which is alerting enough.

If the scrape returns nothing new, the run exits without creating Kaggle
dataset versions or sending messages.
